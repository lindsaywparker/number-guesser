# NUMBER GUESSER

Number Guesser is a page that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what that number is.  

Based on how the user's guess compares to the random number, feedback of 'too high' or 'too low' is provided.

If the user correctly guesses the random number, the page returns 'BOOM!' and the user then resets the game to play again.

In subsequent phases of development, the ability for the user to dictate the minimum and maximum of the random number range was added.
